# Casper Launch - Deploy a Casper validator - The Bware way

## What do you first need to know

This repository is **NOT** an official repository offered by CasperLabs or other parties associeted directly with them.
The scripts were written by the **BwareLabs** team internally for easily deploying a validator node on either mainnet or testnet.
We highly recommend that you first read the [Casper Official Documentation] (https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/node-operator/index.html) in order to understand what is happening behind the curtains.
Great thanks to the **Casper community** for the [How-To-Casper] (https://github.com/make-software/how-to-casperlabs) repository. This repository is offering a great summary of how to deploy a Casper validator and was the main source of inspiration for the scripts which we provide.
